Below is a README file template that provides detailed instructions on setting up a web application with a Django backend and a React frontend. This guide assumes that the person downloading the source code from GitHub does not have the necessary software installed (npm, Python 3, or any code editor).

# Learning Management System

Welcome to the setup guide for Learning Management System. This application is built using Django as the backend framework and React for the frontend.

## Summary
Step 1: Install python3
Step 2: Install Node.js and npm
Step 3: Install Visual Studio Code
Step 4: Create lms Database using provided sql file that contains DDL and Data
Step 5: Download code from Github and open the downloaded folder in Visual Studio Code
Step 6: Install the necessary dependencies for Django and React.
Step 7: Run the backend - [Open a terminal, type 'cd lms_controller' and then type 'python3 manage.py runserver'
Step 8: Run the frontend - [Open a new terminal, type 'cd lms_controller/lms_client' and then type 'npm run dev'
Step 9: Open the link [http://127.0.0.1:8000] in a web browser.
Step 10: On the website, click login and use the following credentials: ['EmilyRichards','password123'] to login into a student account. Or, ['JessicaJones', 'password101'] to login as an instructor. Or register for a new account.

## Additional Information

For detailed information on how to use and develop this project, please refer to the detailed documentation below.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to install the following on your machine:

1. **Python 3**: Needed to run the Django backend.
2. **Node.js and npm**: Required for managing frontend dependencies and running the React application.
3. **Visual Studio Code** (optional, but recommended): A code editor that can help with development.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Python 3

#### Windows:
1. Download the Python installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
2. Run the installer. Ensure you check the box that says "Add Python 3.x to PATH" at the beginning of the installation process.
3. To verify the installation, open Command Prompt and type:
   ```
   python --version
   pip --version
   ```

#### macOS:
1. You can install Python using Homebrew (a package manager for macOS). If you don't have Homebrew installed, open Terminal and run:
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. Then install Python 3 by running:
   ```
   brew install python
   ```
3. To verify the installation, in your Terminal run:
   ```
   python3 --version
   pip3 --version
   ```

#### Linux:
1. Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can check your Python version by running:
   ```
   python3 --version
   ```
2. If Python is not installed, you can install it using your distributionâ€™s package manager (for Ubuntu):
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   ```

### Step 2: Install Node.js and npm

#### Windows and macOS:
1. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Npm is included with Node.js.
2. To verify the installation, run:
   ```
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

#### Linux:
1. You can install Node.js and npm from the NodeSource repository which provides up-to-date versions. Run:
   ```
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt install -y nodejs
   ```
2. Verify the installation:
   ```
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

### Step 3: Install Visual Studio Code

1. Download Visual Studio Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.
3. After installation, launch Visual Studio Code.

### Step 4: Setup the Project

#### Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [URL to your GitHub repository]
   cd [repository name]
   ```
#### Set up the Database (Mysql Workbench)
1. Run the provided sql document with necessary DDL and Data.
2. A database 'lms' will be created.
   
#### Set up the Backend (Django)
1. Navigate to the backend directory: Open a terminal
   ```
   cd lms_controller
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run migrations:
   ```
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```
6. Start the backend server:
   ```
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

#### Set up the Frontend (React)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory: Open a new Terminal
   ```
   cd lms_controller
   cd lms_client
   ```
3. Install npm dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the React development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

After setting up both the backend and frontend, you can access the application by visiting [http://127.0.0.1:8000] in your web browser.
